this is where I'm archiving every unused files :

- Files for other version (PSP, PS2, PS3, BEAGLE, PANDORA, Windows, ARM, etc...)
- Various files that where in the original repo by skmp
- Files generated by AI


I keep all of this in an archive, that way :
- Github clearly indicates what langage is used here
- help make a repomix or whatever that could be done with a repo
- general clean-up
