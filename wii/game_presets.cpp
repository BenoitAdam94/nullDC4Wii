        [keyword]           <- case-insensitive substring matched against filename
        [kw1][kw2][kw3]     <- a section may list several aliases; the section
                                applies if ANY of them matches the filename
                                (e.g. [streetfighter32][doubleimpact][double impact]).
                                The FIRST alias is the canonical name shown in
                                the options menu. Any number of aliases per section.
        <kw1><kw2>          <- angle brackets are the SAME alias match as
                                square brackets, but ONLY apply on real Wii U
                                hardware running vWii (see main.cpp g_is_wiiu,
                                set from WiiDRC_Inited() — independent of
                                whether a GamePad is actually paired). [square]
                                and <angle> alias groups may be mixed freely
                                on one line, in any order, any number of
                                times; if ANY group on the line uses <angle>
                                brackets, the whole section is Wii-U-gated.
                                Put the <angle> section BEFORE the plain
                                [square] section for the same game (first
                                match wins, more specific first — same rule
                                as before):
                                    <segatetris><sega tetris>   ; Wii U
                                    accuracy=accurate
                                    [segatetris][sega tetris]   ; Wii (fallback)
                                    accuracy=fast
                                A real Wii simply fails the Wii U gate and
                                falls through to the plain section below it.
        accuracy=fast       <- only fields listed are overridden
        graphics=low        <- low | normal. TEXTURE FILTER ONLY:
                                low=GX_NEAR (point sampling, best for 240p
                                games whose art already matches the output
                                resolution), normal=GX_LINEAR (bilinear).
                                The former high/extra levels were just a fixed
                                (lod_bias, bias clamp, aniso) bundle glued onto
                                normal; those are the three separate keys below
                                now. Old configs saying high/extra still load —
                                they map to normal, and a log line points at
                                gx=/lod_bias=/aniso= for the rest.
        gx=on               <- on/off (GX_ENABLE/GX_DISABLE), the biasclamp +
                                edgelod pair of GX_InitTexObjLOD() — the only
                                two GX_DISABLE/GX_ENABLE arguments that call
                                takes (see gxRend.cpp ApplyGraphismPreset).
                                biasclamp stops lod_bias from pushing a
                                minified texel past the point where its
                                footprint no longer covers the pixel (blur /
                                shimmer on steep surfaces); edgelod computes
                                the LOD from adjacent instead of diagonal
                                texels. off (default) = legacy. NOTE aniso
                                below forces edgelod on by itself — libogc
                                requires it whenever maxaniso > 1.
        lod_bias=0.0        <- -1 | -0.75 | -0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5, texture LOD bias
                                added to the computed LOD before the mip /
                                filter decision. Negative sharpens (samples a
                                larger level than the footprint asks for),
                                positive blurs. 0.0 (default) is the hardware
                                default and a true no-op.
        aniso=0x            <- 0x | 2x | 4x, anisotropic filtering: the TX unit
                                iterates its square filter along the axis of
                                anisotropy, one extra filter cycle per level
                                (sharper textures on surfaces seen at a steep
                                angle, at texture fill-rate cost). Hollywood
                                only implements 1x/2x/4x — there is no 8x mode;
                                an old aniso=8x line loads clamped to 4x.
                                REQUIRES mipmap=fast or mipmap=trilinear: the
                                TX unit only iterates anisotropy when the min
                                filter is GX_LIN_MIP_LIN, which needs a
                                generated mip chain, so aniso does NOTHING on a
                                game left at mipmap=off (the default). Asking
                                for 2x/4x does promote an already-mipmapped
                                texture to trilinear on its own.
                                0x (default) = off.
        8bpp=i8_stub
        vq_cmpr=on          <- on/off, decodes VQ textures to GX CMPR (DXT1,
                                4 bits/texel) instead of 16bpp. Only useful with
                                tex_cache=very_fast_plus: at that size a VQ
                                texture fits its address-derived cache slot, so
                                it no longer overruns the neighbouring texture
                                (the classic very_fast VQ corruption) and no
                                longer needs the overflow arena. Costs a second
                                lossy pass on top of VQ, so smooth gradients
                                band. 565 VQ source only; 1555/4444 keep the
                                16bpp path since CMPR has no usable alpha.
                                Default off.
        jojo_fix=on         <- on/off, enables the gxRend.cpp TLUT-checksum-skip
                                and CACHE_FAST PalSelect-masking optimizations
                                (see plugs/drkPvr/gxRend.cpp JOJO_FIX()).
                                Default off leaves every other game's
                                texture caching/palette behavior unchanged.
        decal_alpha=on      <- on/off, selects ShadInstr==2 (DecalAlpha) blending.
                                off=legacy GX_MODULATE (faster, wrong transparency)
                                on=correct DecalAlpha shading (GX_DECAL).
        speed_limiter=on    <- on/off, caps emulation at real-hardware (100%) speed.
                                off=uncapped (may run >100% on light frames, default)
                                on=sleeps the difference each vblank so speed never
                                  exceeds 100% (never penalizes frames already at
                                  or below 100%; see plugs/drkPvr/SPG.cpp).
        render_delay=on     <- on/off, hardware-like HOLLY IRQ delays (see
                                plugs/drkPvr/SPG.cpp RENDER_DELAY()). Games
                                that pace their main loop off the TA
                                list-complete / render-done interrupts break
                                when those fire (nearly) instantly: emulation
                                speed reads >100% while the game renders only
                                a few frames per second (Marvel vs Capcom 2).
                                on delays each list-complete IRQ by 200 SH4
                                cycles and staggers render-done ISP/TSP/Video
                                at 800k/850k/900k cycles after STARTRENDER;
                                off (default, legacy) keeps instant list IRQs
                                and the single render-done burst.
        arm7_speed=1        <- 0/1/2, ARM7 sound-CPU speed divider stage:
                                effective clock = ~10 MHz >> stage (see
                                plugs/vbaARM/arm_aica.cpp). The AICA driver
                                free-runs its poll/scan main loop far more
                                than any driver needs, so 1 (half) or 2
                                (quarter) reclaims host CPU. Default 0
                                (off/legacy); per-game, verify music/SFX
                                timing by ear before keeping — stage 2 has
                                been found to break audio timing.
        sh4_clock=175       <- 150..200, SH4 underclock: effective SH4 core
                                clock in MHz (clamped to [150,200]; see
                                plugins/plugin_types.h SH4_CLOCK_EFF). 200
                                (default) is real-Dreamcast full speed. Lower
                                budgets fewer emulated SH4 cycles per audio/
                                video/RTC frame, so the Wii host renders more
                                output frames per second (smoother), at the
                                cost of the emulated machine acting like a
                                slower Dreamcast — CPU-heavy games drop
                                internal frames. Audio stays in sync (the AICA
                                anchor scales with the same clock). A pure
                                performance knob — A/B per game.
        jit_sbp=1           <- 0/1/2, JIT_SBP (Stale Block Protection). Gates
                                all three defenses against executing stale or
                                self-modified translations (see
                                dc/sh4/rec_v2/driver.cpp): the boot-entry cache
                                flush at 0x..08300 / 0x..10000 (IP.BIN -> game
                                binary transition), the runtime block-check
                                guard (a source-byte compare emitted at each
                                guarded block's entry), and the full cache
                                clear on a guard failure. 1 guards the
                                addresses known to self-modify (DOA2LE, Shenmue
                                1/2); 2 guards every RAM block, which is slow
                                but catches unknown cases. Default 1 (known).
                                0 reproduces the legacy zero-protection
                                behavior, for A/B comparison only.
        dma_fix=on          <- on/off, bundles the ch2/PVR/Sort/AICA-G2 DMA
                                correctness fixes found by diffing against the
                                verified-working NullDC PSP port (see
                                dc/sh4/dmac.cpp, dc/pvr/pvr_sb_regs.cpp,
                                dc/aica/aica_if.cpp): correct CHCR TE/DE
                                writeback (real SH4 sets TE and never clears
                                DE), no SB_C2DSTAT clobber, no bogus PVR-DMA
                                alignment check, the Sort-DMA link-sentinel fix
                                (WinCE games), and deferred (non-instant) AICA
                                G2-DMA completion + SB_E2ST. Default on. off
                                reproduces the legacy pre-fix behavior, for A/B
                                comparison only.
        fastmem=on          <- on/off, PPC-MMU fastmem for the SH4 dynarec
                                (wii/wii_fastmem.cpp). Maps the DC address
                                space at EA 0-0x1FFFFFFF via segment regs +
                                a hashed page table so JIT loads/stores are
                                branchless (rlwinm+load, no compares, no

                                table). Experimental — A/B per game.
        bcache=on           <- on/off, flat dynamic-branch dispatch cache for
                                the SH4 dynarec (blockmanager.cpp bm_bcache).

                                {addr, code} entry = one data cache line,
                                instead of chasing cache[] -> DynarecBlock
                                across two lines + a counter write. Default
                                off (legacy). Perf preset — A/B per game.
        dyn_ic=2            <- 0/1/2, per-site inline cache on the SH4

                                VERTEX_COLOR()). Default off keeps the
                                old flat-grayscale behavior for every other game;
                                Crazy Taxi needs this on for its HUD arrow/dollar

                                BLEND_MODE()). on (default, correct) applies the
                                polygon's actual blend factors each frame;
                                off (legacy) skips the per-polygon override and uses
                                the GX default, which is faster but renders
                                Resident Evil 3's translucent polygons incorrectly.
        fps_boost=on        <- on/off, only used when blend_mode=on (see gxRend.cpp
                                BLEND_FPS_BOOST()). on forces alpha_fmt=0 (skips the
                                alpha-test/ZCompLoc pass) for every polygon outside
                                the translucent list, saving a couple of FPS (e.g.
                                Castlevania) at the cost of incorrect alpha on some
                                opaque/punch-through polys. Default off (correct).
        punch_through=on    <- on/off, punch-through list fix (see gxRend.cpp
                                PUNCH_THROUGH_FIX()). on (default, correct) draws
                                lists in OP -> PT -> TR order with the PT list
                                alpha-tested against PT_ALPHA_REF and blending off,
                                like real PVR; off (legacy) draws PT polys last, in
                                the translucent blend state.
        offset_color=on     <- on/off, offset (specular) color (see gxRend.cpp
                                OFFSET_COLOR_FIX()). on renders textured polys as
                                PIX = base*tex + offset like real PVR (specular
                                highlights on cars/water), costing 4 bytes/vertex
                                of FIFO and a second TEV stage on offset polys;
                                off (default, legacy) drops the offset color.
        trans_sort=on       <- on/off, translucent depth sort (see gxRend.cpp
                                TRANS_SORT()). Real PVR autosorts translucent
                                pixels in hardware; on sorts the TR strips
                                back-to-front (painter's algorithm) before
                                drawing, fixing wrong overlaps in alpha-heavy
                                scenes, at some CPU cost per frame;
                                off (default, legacy) draws in submission order.
        autosort=2          <- 0..4, REAL per-pixel PVR autosort via GX depth
                                peeling (see gxRend.cpp AUTOSORT()). The value
                                is the max number of translucent depth LAYERS
                                composited per pixel: each layer costs ~2 extra
                                walks of the translucent geometry plus 2 EFB Z
                                copies, so this is very GPU-heavy — use 2 or 3,
                                per-game, only where trans_sort's per-strip
                                painter sort is not enough (intersecting or
                                interleaved translucent geometry). Overrides
                                trans_sort; layer_sort overrides it. Best with
                                punch_through=on. 0 (default): off.
        render_to_texture=on <- on/off/overlay/keep, render-to-texture support (see
                                gxRend.cpp RENDER_TO_TEXTURE()). Frames whose
                                write address (FB_W_SOF1) has bit 24 set target
                                the 64-bit texture area — mirrors, TV screens,
                                sniper scopes, some menu effects.
                                on renders them and copies the EFB back into
                                emulated VRAM at FB_W_SOF1 so the game can bind
                                the result as a texture, at the cost of an EFB
                                copy + CPU convert per RTT frame;
                                keep is on PLUS the render does not consume
                                the TA list, so the display render that follows
                                draws the whole accumulated list -- needed by a
                                game that renders one list twice (Silent Scope's
                                sniper scope). The shared list is split by
                                user tile clip: clipped strips go to the
                                texture, unclipped ones to the screen;
                                overlay does not resolve a texture but carries
                                the pass's geometry into the next display frame
                                and draws it last, flat on top (near-plane
                                parked, GX_ALWAYS, no Z-write) — for passes we
                                cannot resolve, e.g. Silent Scope's crosshair;
                                off (default, legacy) drops those frames, but
                                leaves their geometry in the buffers where it
                                leaks into the next frame uncontrolled.
        mipmap=fast         <- off/fast/trilinear (or 0/1/2), GX mipmap

                                fast = generated mip chain sampled with

                                shimmer at near-zero GPU cost; trilinear = best
                                quality but takes 2 texture cycles/texel on
                                Hollywood, halving texture fill rate (-40% FPS
                                in Test Drive 6).
        yuv_stride=auto     <- off/auto/always (default auto). Decides the REAL
                                per-row pitch of a YUV422 source, which can be
                                smaller than the declared power-of-two texture
                                size. auto = only for a texture the YUV converter
                                wrote, i.e. an FMV frame (Bomberman, Test Drive 6,
                                Dino Crisis). always = the old behaviour, taken
                                from TA_YUV_TEX_CTRL for EVERY YUV422 texture:
                                a game that never programs that register then
                                decodes its YUV art as 16x16 and it goes black
                                (Soul Calibur character select). texctl = auto,
                                plus the real hardware stride wherever the
                                texture's TCW.StrideSel bit is set: the row pitch
                                is TEXT_CONTROL[4:0] x 32 texels. Used only as a
                                fallback when the converter never tracked the
                                surface, and applied to the SOURCE PITCH, never
                                to the declared width - rewriting the width
                                rescales every UV, which is the tearing itself.
                                texctl also covers the planar RGB path, the last
                                place still guessing a blind 512. Try texctl
                                first if a movie is still sliced under auto;
                                always only after that.
        yuv_twiddle_fix=on  <- on/off (default off). Fixes TWIDDLED YUV422
                                textures (static YUV art, not FMV): the legacy
                                decoder swapped the two u16 halves of each source
                                u32 and read luma/chroma from the wrong byte, so
                                the picture collapses onto a green<->magenta
                                duotone. Virtua Fighter 3tb "FIRST MATCH".
        seam_fix=on         <- on/off (default off), half-texel UV inset via a
                                per-texture GX matrix (see gxRend.cpp SEAM_FIX()).
                                Stops GX_LINEAR from sampling past a sprite's own
                                texels, killing the thin black "seam" line between
                                2D tiles/sprites without dropping to GX_NEAR. Keeps
                                wrap/tiling intact (sub-texel shift only).
        fog=on              <- on/off (default off). Per-polygon PVR2 fog (see
                                gxRend.cpp FOG()): honours each polygon's
                                TSP.FogCtrl - look-up table (FOG_TABLE +
                                FOG_DENSITY, colour FOG_COL_RAM), per-vertex
                                (coefficient = the vertex's offset-colour alpha,
                                colour FOG_COL_VERT), no fog, and LUT mode 2.
                                Evaluated per vertex on the CPU and blended by one
                                extra TEV stage. Gives racers/outdoor games their
                                distance haze back instead of hard geometry that
                                pops in. Costs 4 bytes/vertex plus a TEV stage on
                                fogged polygons only.
        fixed_depth=1       <- 0/1/2, fixed depth projection (see gxRend.cpp
                                FIXED_DEPTH_*()). 0 (default, legacy) tracks the
                                scene's min/max depth on every TA vertex to fit
                                the Z range each frame; 1 (wide) and 2 (tight)
                                skip that per-vertex tracking and project with
                                fixed near/far planes — slightly faster vertex
                                decode, but a coarser Z buffer. wide covers
                                W=[0.0001..100000] (safe everywhere, may
                                Z-fight); tight covers W=[0.1..25000] (much
                                finer Z, but geometry outside that range clips,
                                so per-game only).
        legacy_depth=on     <- reproduce the depth pipeline exactly as it stood
                                at commit 1bb8c27, the last state known to render
                                certain games correctly. Three things differ from
                                today and all three are restored together: fixed
                                planes NEAR=0.001 / FAR=10000*1.001; vert_base
                                clamps 1/W at 0.001 instead of 0.0001; and no
                                per-vertex min/max tracking or margin/HUD vertex
                                fixups. The clamp is the part fixed_depth cannot
                                express, which is why no fixed_depth value
                                reproduces 1bb8c27. Overrides fixed_depth.
        depth_clip=1        <- 0/1/2, real-Wii Z-clip workaround (see gxRend.cpp
                                DEPTH_CLIP_*()). Dolphin never Z-clips, so
                                menus/intros that sit on or beyond the depth
                                planes show there but vanish on real hardware.
                                0 (default, legacy) leaves XF clipping on;
                                1 pads the dynamic near plane by 0.1% so the
                                nearest 2D layer can't land exactly on it;

                                clips the HUD, which parks nearer than that; this
                                re-parks the HUD onto the near plane (screen
                                position preserved) and draws it GX_ALWAYS.
                                1 = overlay (no Z-write) — HUD may be overdrawn by

                                the HUD stays on top; avoid on games with a large

                                mode (GX_SetZTexture): every fragment drawn while
                                it's bound gets a constant bias added to its depth
                                before the Z test/write, a slope-independent

                                at the start of the next one. One frame of
                                extra display latency; big FPS gain whenever
                                the GPU takes a meaningful slice of the frame.

                                re-fetching every texel from RAM; on invalidates
                                only when a texture is actually re-decoded, so
                                unchanged textures stay cached across frames —

                                this also mutes 16-bit music/voices, so it is a
                                per-game hack, not a general fix.

                                setting carried over this boot) — leaving
                                the key out entirely does the same thing
                                UNLESS an earlier section already forced it.

    [default] is a special section, not matched against the filename: its
    fields are applied first, on every launch, before the per-game match
    below runs. Per-game sections only need to list fields that differ
    from [default].

    First matching rule wins.
    Fields left unset by both [default] and the matched section stay at
    whatever the user selected in the UI.

    The file is never kept in RAM: game_presets_apply() streams it back off
    the card/drive (one pass for [default], one for the per-game match),
    parsing into a single scratch slot — the old 4096-entry table cost
    ~2.6 MB of MEM2.

    IMPORTANT: matching is done by lowercasing BOTH the filename and the keyword,
    then using plain strstr() — no strncasecmp needed (avoids devkitPPC/newlib issues).
